# Guevara Auto Service - Final Project

## How to run
- Put the project in a subfolder of your GitHub `wdd231` repo (e.g., `finalproject/guevara-auto-service`)
- Ensure `data/services.json` and `images/` are in place
- Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages for the repository or serve locally with a static server.

## Notes

- Replace the demo video URL in footers with the YouTube/Loom link after upload.
- The form uses GET to `form-action.html` which displays submitted values.
